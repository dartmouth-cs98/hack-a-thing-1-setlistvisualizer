<h1>Setlist Visualizer Tutorial</h1>
<p>To choose your own concert/artists to visualize, first go to setlist.fm and find the desired artist. Then, follow the following sections to fill out the form on the main page</p>
<h2>Unique Artist URL</h2>
<p>This is the unique URL that setlist.fm uses for that artist. For example, if you were to Google search: "Dave Matthews Band setlist fm", you'd probably land here:</p>
<p>https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/dave-matthews-band-43d6e713.html</p>
<p>From this, the unique URL is:</p>
<p>dave-matthews-band-43d6e713.html</p>

<h2>Start URL</h2>
<p>What setlist do you want to start at? Say I have a particular timeframe in mind. Then, I would go to the first setlistfm URL I want. Let's start with Dave Matthew's concert at the Gorge:</p>
<p>https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/dave-matthews-band/2018/the-gorge-amphitheatre-george-wa-7be87614.html</p>

<p>To get the Start URL, just take the last half of it, excluding https. From the above URL, you would get:</p>
<p>dave-matthews-band/2018/the-gorge-amphitheatre-george-wa-7be87614.html</p>

<h2>Stop URL</h2>
<p>What setlist do you want to end at? If you don't care, then just type:</p>
<p>''''</p>
<p>Or provide a URL where the tour ended, or any concert you want to stop at, following the same process as above in the Start URL:</p>
<p>dave-matthews-band/2018/les-schwab-amphitheater-bend-or-7be82af4.html</p>
