# Hack A Thing - Setlist Visualizer

## Alexander Danilowicz, Weiling Huang

New tools learned:

- Django

(Seriously, we knew so little about Django we thought it was a front-end only framework at first and Flask was back-end only...) 

## Running it

```python3 manage.py runserver```

Then go to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
